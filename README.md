## Introduction

I created a fictitious blog site using React.js, aiming to deepen my understanding of the framework's functionalities and structures. Through this hands-on experience, I've focused on implementing key features such as components architecture, routing, state management, form handling, and more. The goal is not only to build a simulated blog but also to explore various aspects of React, from stateful class components to functional components with hooks, all while emphasizing good practices in web development.

## Features

- Search functionality
- Dynamic routing
- Sorting and Filtering in descending order
- Form handling
- Card Display
- Page Back Functionality
